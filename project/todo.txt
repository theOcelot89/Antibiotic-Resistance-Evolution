-> For some reason when plt.show() is called within an env.view() it renders all the plots on the script when they are initialized 

-> IMPORTANT pass genotypes in DX/dt in order to run correct DONE
-> Integrate the dx/dt workflow inside the environment class DONE
-> Save figs to dynamically created folders
